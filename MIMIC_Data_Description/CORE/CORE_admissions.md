# CORE::Patient

Patients table


Information that is consistent for the lifetime of a patient is stored in this table.

## Detailed Description 

```diff
- subject_id
```
subject_id is a unique identifier which specifies an individual patient. 
Any rows associated with a single subject_id pertain to the same individual. 
As subject_id is the primary key for the table, it is unique for each row.

```diff
- gender
```
gender is the genotypical sex of the patient.

```diff
- anchor_age, anchor_year, anchor_year_group
```
These columns provide information regarding the actual patient year for the patient admission, and the patient’s age at that time.
- anchor_year is a shifted year for the patient.
- anchor_year_group is a range of years - the patient’s anchor_year occurred during this range.
- anchor_age is the patient’s age in the anchor_year.
- Example: a patient has an anchor_year of 2153, anchor_year_group of 2008 - 2010, and an anchor_age of 60.
	- The year 2153 for the patient corresponds to 2008, 2009, or 2010.
	- The patient was 60 in the shifted year of 2153, i.e. they were 60 in 2008, 2009, or 2010.
	- A patient admission in 2154 will occur in 2009-2011, an admission in 2155 will occur in 2010-2012, and so on.
	
```diff
